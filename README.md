A Rust library for shortest-path maritime route computation.

> **Status: pre-release.** This repository contains the EUPL-1.2
> legal/governance scaffolding, the vendored Eurostat MARNET data, and
> a `build.rs` that compiles the MARNET GeoPackages into rkyv graph
> archives at build time. `Graph::load`/`Graph::from_bytes` and
> Dijkstra routing (`Graph::route`) have landed; distance matrices and
> further algorithms follow in later tickets — see
> [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the scope policy.

## Installation

Not yet published to crates.io. Once published:

```sh
cargo add rustyroute
```

## Usage

Public routing APIs will be documented here when they are introduced.

## CLI

An optional `rustyroute` binary is available behind the `cli` feature.
It is not built by default, so library-only consumers never compile
`clap`:

```sh
cargo install --path . --features cli
```

```sh
rustyroute route --from 43.30,5.37 --to 31.23,121.47
```

| Flag | Values | Default |
|------|--------|---------|
| `--from` / `--to` | `lat,lng` decimal degrees | required |
| `--resolution` | `5`, `10`, `20`, `50`, `100` (km) | `50` |
| `--block` | comma-separated edge groups, e.g. `suezCanal,menaiStrait` | none |
| `--format` | `json`, `geojson`, `line` | `geojson` |

The `cli` feature also enables every `data-{N}km` feature so an
installed binary can serve any `--resolution`.

Results go to stdout, diagnostics to stderr. Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | route found |
| 1 | bad arguments |
| 2 | no route between the endpoints |
| 3 | graph data unavailable for the requested resolution |
| 4 | failed to write output |
